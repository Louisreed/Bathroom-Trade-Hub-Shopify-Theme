# AAA Membership App Integration Analysis

## Overview

The **AAA Membership App** is a third-party Shopify application developed by AtTrillion that provides comprehensive membership management, content restriction, and dynamic pricing capabilities for the Bathroom Trade Hub store. The app enables trade-focused features including member-only content access, tiered pricing discounts, and specialized checkout processing.

## App Details

- **Provider**: AtTrillion (aaawebstore.com)
- **App Name**: AAA Memberships
- **Integration Type**: Third-party Shopify app with extensive theme integration
- **Primary Domain**: `membership.aaawebstore.com`
- **CDN**: `shopifycdn.aaawebstore.com`
- **Shop Domain**: `bathroomtradehub.co.uk`

## Core Functionality

### 1. Content Access Control

#### **Template-Level Protection**

The app protects different template types through the main helper system:

- **Products**: Restricted product access based on membership status
- **Collections**: Member-only collection visibility
- **Pages**: Protected page content for trade customers
- **Blog/Articles**: Member-exclusive content access

#### **Implementation**

```liquid
{% if template == 'product' %}
  {% include 'aaa-product-page-filter' %}
{% endif %}
{% if template == 'collection' %}
  {% include 'aaa_mem_helper' with 'collection' %}
{% endif %}
```

#### **Access Rules**

- **Show Rules**: Content visible only to logged-in members with specific tags
- **Hide Rules**: Content hidden from specific member groups
- **Default Behavior**: Content hidden from non-members when protection is enabled

### 2. Dynamic Pricing System

#### **Membership Discount Logic**

The app calculates personalized discounts based on customer tags and shop metafields:

```liquid
# Discount calculation flow:
1. Check shop.metafields.aaa_mem_price for discount rules
2. Match customer tags against rule conditions
3. Extract discount percentage from matched rules
4. Apply discount to product pricing
```

#### **Pricing Integration Points**

- **Product Pages**: Real-time discount calculation and display
- **Collection Pages**: Bulk pricing updates across product grids
- **Cart**: Membership pricing validation before checkout
- **Product Cards**: Consistent pricing across all product displays

#### **Discount Rule Format**

```liquid
# Metafield format: "customer_tag,collection_handle,discount_percentage"
# Example: "trade_customer,bathroom_fixtures,25%"
```

### 3. Checkout Integration

#### **Cart Processing**

The app intercepts cart submissions and processes them through AAA's external service:

1. **Cart Capture**: Intercepts form submissions to `/cart`
2. **Data Preparation**: Packages cart data with customer information
3. **External Processing**: Sends data to `membership.aaawebstore.com/memberAjaxFormSubmit.php`
4. **Redirect Handling**: Manages checkout redirects based on membership status

#### **JavaScript Integration**

```javascript
// Cart submission interception
$(document).on("submit", "#cart, form[action='/cart']", function () {
  // AAA processing logic
  var dataform = {
    formAction: "generateDraftOrder",
    customer_id: cusId,
    domain: "bathroomtradehub.co.uk",
    cart: cart,
  };
  // Send to AAA service
});
```

#### **Checkout Flow**

1. **Standard Cart**: Customer adds items to cart
2. **AAA Interception**: App captures cart submission
3. **Membership Validation**: Verifies customer membership status
4. **Discount Application**: Applies appropriate membership discounts
5. **Checkout Redirect**: Redirects to appropriate checkout (standard or member)

### 4. Customer Tag Management

#### **Tag-Based Access Control**

The app uses Shopify customer tags to determine:

- **Membership Level**: Three tiers - `standard` (no tags), `hubpro-free`, and `hubpro-plus`
- **Content Access**: Which products/pages customer can view based on AAA membership rules
- **Discount Eligibility**: Percentage discounts based on membership level and AAA metafield rules
- **Visual Experience**: Custom branding, colors, and logos based on HubPro membership tier
- **Navigation Access**: Menu visibility controlled per membership level

#### **Tag Matching Logic**

```liquid
# Case-insensitive tag matching
{% assign clean_customer_tag = customer_tag | downcase | strip %}
{% assign clean_rule_tag = key_wrd.first | downcase | strip %}
{% if clean_customer_tag == clean_rule_tag %}
  # Apply membership rule
{% endif %}
```

## Business Logic

### 1. Trade Customer Benefits

#### **Membership Tiers**

The theme implements a sophisticated HubPro membership system with three distinct customer types:

- **Standard Customers**: Regular pricing, limited access (logged out visitors OR logged in customers without HubPro tags)
- **HubPro Free (`hubpro-free` tag)**: Entry-level trade membership with basic benefits and custom branding
- **HubPro Plus (`hubpro-plus` tag)**: Premium trade membership with enhanced benefits, priority access, and premium branding

#### **HubPro System Features**

**Visual Branding Customization:**

- **Custom Logos**: Different logos for each membership tier (desktop and mobile variants)
- **Color Schemes**: Comprehensive color overrides for each membership level including:
  - Text, background, and highlight colors
  - Button colors and gradients
  - Product pricing colors
  - Sale tags and rating colors
  - Error and info message colors
  - Drawer and modal colors

**Menu Visibility Control:**

- **Conditional Navigation**: Menu items can be shown/hidden based on customer type
- **Per-Menu Configuration**: Individual menu items can be configured for each membership tier
- **Automatic Detection**: System automatically detects customer type based on tags

**Content Personalization:**

- **Announcement Bar**: Different colors and messaging for each membership tier
- **Header Logos**: Tier-specific branding in header
- **Form Styling**: Custom form sections for membership signup and management

#### **Discount Structure**

- **Percentage-Based**: Discounts applied as percentages (e.g., 25% off)
- **Collection-Specific**: Different discounts for different product categories
- **Customer Tag-Based**: Discounts tied to specific customer classifications

### 2. Content Restriction Strategy

#### **Access Levels**

- **Public**: Available to all visitors
- **Member-Only**: Requires customer login and membership
- **Trade-Only**: Restricted to verified trade customers
- **Premium**: Highest tier access for premium members

#### **Implementation Strategy**

- **Progressive Disclosure**: Show appropriate content based on membership level
- **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback to standard experience if AAA service unavailable
- **No-Access Messaging**: Clear communication when access is restricted

## Configuration & Setup

"customer_tag,collection_handle,discount_percentage"

# Access rule format:
"customer_tag,show|hide"
```

### 2. Customer Tag Requirements

#### **Tag Naming Convention**

- **Consistent Casing**: App handles case-insensitive matching
- **HubPro Standard Tags**: `hubpro-free` and `hubpro-plus` for membership tiers
- **AAA Integration Tags**: Custom tags defined in AAA app metafields for pricing rules
- **Hierarchical Structure**: Support for multiple membership levels with priority system

#### **Tag Management**

- **Automatic Assignment**: Tags assigned through membership signup process
- **Manual Override**: Admin ability to manually assign/remove tags
- **Tag Validation**: System validates tag existence before applying rules

## Current Status & Issues

### 1. Metafield Synchronization Issue

#### **Problem Identified**

The debug logs reveal that AAA app discount rules are not properly syncing to Shopify metafields:

```javascript
console.log("❌ AAA app has NOT saved discount rules to Shopify metafields");
console.log(
  "❌ Your discount config exists in AAA dashboard but not in Shopify"
);
```

#### **Impact**

- **No Discounts Applied**: Membership discounts not functioning

- **Debug Data Available**: Comprehensive logging system in place for troubleshooting

#### **Resolution Required**

- **AAA Support Contact**: Need to resolve metafield synchronization
- **Data Verification**: Confirm discount rules exist in AAA dashboard
- **Sync Process**: Trigger manual sync or fix automatic sync process

### 2. Checkout Integration Status

#### **Current State**

  loggedIn: true / false,
  customerId: customer.id,
  customerTags: customer.tags,
  totalTags: customer.tags.size,
});
```

#### **Metafield Inspection**

```javascript
console.log("🏪 SHOP METAFIELDS (aaa_mem_price):");
console.log("Raw shop.metafields object:", shop.metafields);
```

#### **Pricing Calculation**

```javascript
console.log("📊 FINAL CALCULATION RESULT:", {
  membershipDiscountPercent: membership_discount_percent,
  hasMembershipPricing: has_membership_pricing,
  discountWillApply: membership_discount_percent > 0,
});
```

### 2. Common Issues & Solutions

#### **No Discounts Applying**

- **Check**: Customer tags match metafield rules
- **Verify**: AAA metafields are populated in Shopify
- **Confirm**: Customer is logged in with appropriate tags

#### **Access Restrictions Not Working**

## Integration Best Practices

### 1. Performance Considerations

#### **Lazy Loading**

- **Script Loading**: AAA scripts loaded only when needed (cart page)
- **Conditional Logic**: Membership checks only when customer is logged in
- **Efficient Loops**: Optimized tag matching and rule processing

#### **Caching Strategy**

- **Metafield Caching**: Shopify handles metafield caching automatically
- **Client-Side Caching**: Membership status cached in browser session
- **Service Calls**: Minimize external service calls through smart caching

### 2. Error Handling Strategy
